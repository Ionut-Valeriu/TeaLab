00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.600 line:0%
It's hot outside. Forks are

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.480 line:0%
melting. Lasagna noodle spice racks

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.040 line:0%
are falling apart. The only way to cool

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.200 line:0%
down is with a drink made of boiling hot

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.680 line:0%
water.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.880 line:0%
The first step to making iced tea is

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.600 line:0%
acquiring tea bags. These can be found

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.680 line:0%
along the public footpaths in the English

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.080 line:0%
countryside. Plucked from tea

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.880 line:0%
trees found in rotting tree stumps,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.840 line:0%
wedged in tree crust, inside tree

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.640 line:0%
forts, or even under couch cushions, you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.080 line:0%
can find black tea almost anywhere. Now

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.100 line:0%
we're going to make piping hot water in a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.960 line:0%
gooseneck kettle, although you can use

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.680 line:0%
any kind of kettleneck you want,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.880 line:0%
including giraffe neck, turtleneck,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.680 line:0%
necklace, or nectarine. Now we'll put

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.320 line:0%
those tea bags in some kind of bag vessel

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.560 line:0%
and pour in the hot water to steep it,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 line:0%
which causes a dark tea cloud to move in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.160 line:0%
like a storm of dissolved compounds,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.080 line:0%
releasing flavor, nutrients, and

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.440 line:0%
untold numbers of haunted tea

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.360 line:0%
spirits into the water and soon into

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360 line:0%
your entire body. Only

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.360 line:0%
steep it for a few minutes because over

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.160 line:0%
steeping it is going to make it bitter

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.040 line:0%
and then it'll never stop complaining

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.520 line:0%
about its ex. Then remove the tea bags

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.100 line:0%
while enjoying a Russian steam bath. Add

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.080 line:0%
in some sugar until it's as sweet as you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.920 line:0%
like. A squeeze of lemon. Now taste and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.760 line:0%
adjust the sweetness before you throw it

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.280 line:0%
in the heat remover. Once that's cold,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.760 line:0%
pour it over hardened water blocks. Add

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.560 line:0%
in some lemon wedges to make it look

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.100 line:0%
cool. Then you have some classic iced

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.400 line:0%
tea, also known as watered down coffee.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.880 line:100%
If you want iced tea with more flavor,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.520 line:100%
grab yourself a raspberry pod and smash

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.960 line:100%
it into raspberry Nuggets. Then brew some

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.480 line:100%
more black tea. Now remove the bags while

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.960 line:100%
giving yourself a Nordic spa experience.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.360 line:100%
I'm going to use this fork as a raspberry

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.680 line:100%
elevator to avoid splashing scalding

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.600 line:100%
water. Then I'm going to use the same

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.100 line:100%
fork to reduce them to ras smither

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.440 line:100%
berryins. Add lemon and sugar to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.040 line:100%
taste. Try to avoid the dumbass move of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.320 line:100%
making this in a jar with no handle. Put

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.680 line:100%
it in the temperature subtract. Then pour

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.080 line:100%
it through a strainer. Enjoy a delicious

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080 line:100%
bite of tasteless berry smithereen

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.320 line:100%
pudding. Then pour over Aquadice and add

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.480 line:100%
some berry nuggets to make it look cool.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.320 line:100%
And now let's take a quick break to read

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320 line:100%
tea leaves. It's a kind of fortune

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.360 line:100%
telling where you make loose leaf tea,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.240 line:100%
you drink the tea, then interpret the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240 line:100%
pattern of the leaves inside the cup to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.640 line:100%
tell your fortune. Oh, okay.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.840 line:100%
MMM. For this next iced tea, we're going

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.920 line:100%
to use Earl Grey, which you can find in

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.100 line:100%
the pockets of an old raincoat. Throw in

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.440 line:100%
the tea bags, add hot water, release the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.880 line:100%
haunted tea spirits. Take the bags out

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.800 line:100%
while watching the Icelandic hot spring

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.440 line:100%
from a safe distance. Add in some mint,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.960 line:100%
Maple syrup, green lemon. Throw it in the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.320 line:100%
molecule slower downer. Then, once it's

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.400 line:100%
cold, pour it on some dried out wet

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.920 line:100%
squares. Earl Grey tea is one of the best

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.200 line:100%
teas to drink when solving a crime, or if

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.520 line:100%
you're just feeling suspicious. Take a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.320 line:100%
moment to pay respect to the tea bag

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.100 line:100%
graveyard. To make green tea,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.800 line:100%
climb to the top of a green tree and grab

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.040 line:100%
some green tea bags, which only ripen at

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.760 line:100%
high altitudes. The bags go in, the water

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.080 line:100%
goes in. We'll use our danger spoon to

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840 line:100%
take the bags out. Pour in

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.760 line:100%
127 bees worth of honey. Take a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.560 line:100%
piece of ginger and delicately slice it.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.640 line:100%
Throw it in, put it in the coolness

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.920 line:100%
multiplier while remembering that time is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.200 line:100%
an illusion. Then pour it over frigid

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.100 line:100%
puddle cubes to make it feel cool. But

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.240 line:100%
the best tasting iced tea comes from tea

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.040 line:100%
bags found inside crop circles. Put out

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.960 line:100%
some of aliens favorite food, which is

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.920 line:100%
cucumbers, and when they come get it,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.560 line:100%
they'll leave a crop circle as a thank

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.400 line:100%
you note, which will make the tea taste

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.080 line:100%
really good. And now enjoy some iced

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.880 line:100%
tea and patiently wait.
